The code imports libraries for working with graphs and data, loads the Wine dataset from OpenML, and stores it as a data table
called wine, with three features selected for analysis. It then plots histograms that show the distribution of values for each
feature. Next, a reference feature (color intensity) is chosen, and scatter plots are created to show its relationship with the
other features. Finally, a single scatter plot is generated between alcohol percentage and color intensity, which is saved as a
PNG file and displayed on the screen.
